Changes in version 0.6

- Fixed a bug in the module library that would cause it to break when
  more than one pair of strings was input with a single read call.

- Added a plain MD5 as well as a MD5-crypt module.  I will add other
  common cryptographic hashes as soon as I can find GPL'able versions of
  them.
