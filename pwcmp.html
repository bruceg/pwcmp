<h1>Password Comparison Modules</h1>

<h2>Input/Output</h2>

<p>Input to the module is a series of pairs of NUL-terminated strings
on standard input.  The first of each pair is the plaintext pass
phrase.  The second of each pair is the stored, hashed pass phrase.
The total size of each pair of strings must not exceed 4096 bytes.</p>

<p>Output from the module is a series of bytes on standard output, one
for each complete pair of input strings.  A zero byte indicates that
the passwords match.</p>

<h2>Code Considerations</h2>

<p>The module must output its comparison status byte immedately after
reading the terminating NUL byte of the second of each pair of
strings, before reading any more data.  This is required to prevent
deadlocking.</p>

<p>The module try to avoid doing any more or less work when the
comparison succeeds than when the comparison fails, to avoid
timing-based attacks on other systems that use the module.</p>
